# squashfs

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/CalebQ42/squashfs)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/CalebQ42/squashfs) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/CalebQ42/squashfs)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/CalebQ42/squashfs)

A PURE Go library to read and write squashfs.

Currently, you can read a squashfs and extract files (folder extraction not supported. Yet).

Special thanks to https://dr-emann.github.io/squashfs/ for some VERY important information in an easy to understand format.
Thanks also to [distri's squashfs library](https://github.com/distr1/distri/tree/master/internal/squashfs) as I referenced it to figure some things out (and double check others).

# Where I'm at

* Working on the File interface that should make it easier to deal with squashfs files. I'm also trying to make them capable for when I get squashing working.
